# pattern-lib
-------------
A library providing some generic design patterns. Obviously it contains only a small amount of commonly known design patterns. Not every single pattern can be implemented in a generic way.

So far it provides the following design patterns that can easily be included in any source code:
1. Memento pattern
2. Composite pattern
3. Builder pattern
4. Singleton pattern

# supplementary

Each generic implementation of the listed design patterns comes along with junit test cases and demos showing the usage of the associated pattern. All those files can be found in the 'example' and 'test' folders.
